## Overview
How might we empower Washington homeowners to better understand and act on the financial savings and environmental benefits of optimizing their utility usage? 


Homeowners in Washington often lack awareness of how everyday utility behaviors—like leaving appliances plugged in, running inefficient lightbulbs, and misjudging the energy cost of activities such as dishwashing and lighting—drive both higher bills and unnecessary emissions. Research shows people consistently underestimate energy use and potential savings by about threefold (Attari et al., 2010), which skews perceptions toward “inconvenient” actions rather than simple efficiency upgrades.The project centers on SDG 12, "Responsible Consumption and Production" and aims to educate residents on practical, low-friction changes (e.g., switching to power‑saving bulbs, unplugging idle devices) that optimize electricity and water usage, reduce environmental impact, and deliver tangible financial benefits.
